\section{Quadratic Functions}
\begin{definition}
  A function $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ with $a\ne 0$ is called a \textbf{quadratic function}. Its graph is called a \textbf{parabola}. By completing the square (let $h=-\dfrac{b}{2a}$ and $k=f(h)$), a quadratic function can written in the \textbf{standard form} (or \textbf{vertex form}): $f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$. The vertical line $x=-\dfrac{b}{2a}$ (or $x=h$) is called the \textbf{axis of symmetry}. The \textbf{vertex} $(h,k)$ is the intersection of the axis of symmetry and the parabola.
\end{definition}
\begin{note}
  The $y$-intercept of a quadratic function is $(0, f(0))$. The $x$-coordinates of $x$-intercepts are the zeros (or roots) of the function $f$, that is the solutions of the equation $f(x)=0$.
\end{note}

\begin{example}
  Find the vertex form of the quadratic function $f(x)=2 x^{2} + 4 x + 1$ and determine the vertex, axis of symmetry, $x$-intercepts, and $y$-intercept of the function.
\end{example}

\begin{note}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A quadratic function $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ can be obtained from $y=x^2$ by a combination of vertical stretch by a factor $|a|$, a vertical reflection if $a<0$, a vertical shift of $k$ units, and a horizontal shift of $h$ units.
    \item The domain of a quadratic function is $(-\infty, \infty)$.
    \item If $a>0$, then the parabola opens upward, the function has a global (absolute) minimum $f\left(-\dfrac{b}{2a}\right)$ (or $f(h)$), and the domain of the function is $\bigg[f\left(-\dfrac{b}{2a}\right), \infty\bigg)$.
    \item If $a<0$, then the parabola opens downward, the function has a global (absolute) maximum $f\left(-\dfrac{b}{2a}\right)$ (or $f(h)$), and the domain of the function is $\bigg(-\infty,f\left(-\dfrac{b}{2a}\right)\bigg]$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{note}

\begin{example}
  A local newspaper currently has 84,000 subscribers at a quarterly charge of \$30. Market research has suggested that if the owners raise the price to \$32, they would lose 5,000 subscribers. Assuming that subscriptions are linearly related to the price, what price should the newspaper charge for a quarterly subscription to maximize their revenue?
