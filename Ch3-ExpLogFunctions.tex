\section{Exponential Functions}
\begin{definition}[Exponential Functions]
For any real number $x$, an exponential function $f$ is a function defined by an equation
$$f(x)=b^x,$$
where $b$ is a positive real number and $b\ne 1$.
\end{definition}
\begin{multicols}{2}
  Let $f(x)=b^x$ be an exponential function. Then
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the domain of $f$ is $(-\infty, \infty)$,
    \item the range of $f$ is $(0, \infty)$,
    \item the $y$-intercept is $(0, 1)$,
    \item $f$ has a horizontal asymptote $y=0$,
    \item $f$ is increasing if $b>1$, 
    \item $f$ is decreasing if $0<b<1$.
  \end{itemize}
  

  Note if $f(x)=ab^x$, then $y$-intercept is $(0,a)$ and $a=f(0)$ is known as the initial value.

\begin{example}
  The population of India was about 1.25 billion in the year 2013, with an annual growth rate of about  1.2\%. This situation is represented by the growth function  $P(t)=1.25(1.012)^t$, where $t$ is the number of years since 2013. To the nearest thousandth, what will the population of India be in 2031?
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  In 2006, $80$ deer were introduced into a wildlife refuge. By 2012, the population had grown to $180$ deer. The population was growing exponentially. Write an algebraic function $N(t)$ representing the population $N$ of deer over time $t$.

\begin{definition}[The Natural Number $e$]
The natrual number, denoted by $e$, the number that 
${\left (1+\dfrac{1}{n} \right )}^n$ approaches to as $n$ increases without bound. Approximately, $e\approx 2.718282$.
\end{definition}



\begin{example}
  Calculate $e^{3.14}$. Round to five decimal places.

\begin{note}[Compound Interest]
Let $P$ be the initial amount of the account, known as the principal, $r$ the annual interest rate, and $t$ is the number of years. The balance $A$ after $t$ years is

\begin{itemize}
  \item $A(t)=P{\left (1+\dfrac{r}{n} \right )}^{nt}$ if the interest is compounded $n$ times per year.
  \item $A(t)=Pe^{rt}$ if the interest is compounded continuously ($n\to \infty$).
\end{itemize}
\end{note}
\begin{example}
  We invest $\$3,000$ in an investment account paying $3\%$ interest compounded quarterly, how much will the account be worth in $10$ years?
\end{example}



\begin{example}
  A person invested $\$1,000$ in an account earning $10\%$ per year compounded continuously. How much was in the account at the end of two and a half year?
\end{example}

\newpage

\begin{example}
  A 529 Plan is a college-savings plan that allows relatives to invest money to pay for a child's future college tuition; the account grows tax-free. Lily wants to set up a 529 account for her new granddaughter and wants the account to grow to $\$40,000$ over $18$ years. She believes the account will earn $6\%$ compounded semi-annually (twice a year). To the nearest dollar, how much will Lily need to invest in the account now?
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  $Radon-222$ decays at a continuous rate of $17.3\%$ per day. How much will $100 mg$ of $Radon-222$ decay to in $3$ days?
